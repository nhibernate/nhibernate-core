              README file for the DocBook XSL Stylesheets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
$Id$

These are XSL stylesheets for transforming DocBook XML document
instances into various output formats.

This README file provides only very minimal documentation on using
the stylesheets. For more complete information, see Bob Stayton's
book "DocBook XSL: The Complete Guide", available online at:

  http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/

Installation

How to use the stylesheets
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The base canonical URI for these stylesheets is:

  http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/

You call any of the stylesheets in this distribution by doing one
of the following:

  - Use the base canonical URI in combination with one of the
    pathnames below. For example, for "chunked" HTML, output:

    http://docbook.sourceforge.net/release/xsl/current/html/chunk.xsl

    If your system has a working XML Catalog or SGML Catalog setup
    (most Linux systems do), then that URI will automatically be
    resolved and replaced with a local pathname on your system.

  - Use a "real" local system base path in combination with one of
    the pathnames below. For example, for "chunked" HTML, output:

    /usr/share/xml/docbook/stylesheet/nwalsh/html/chunk.xsl

To transform documents created with the standard DocBook schema/DTD
(or DocBook NG schema/DTD, use one of the following stylesheets:

  fo/docbook.xsl          - for XSL-FO
  fo/profile-docbook.xsl  - for XSL-FO (single-pass profiled)

  html/docbook.xsl        - for HTML (as a single file)
  html/chunk.xsl          - for HTML (chunked into multiple files)
  html/onechunk.xsl       - for HTML (chunked output in single file)
  html/profile-*          - for HTML (single-pass profiled versions)

  xhtml/*.xsl             - for XHTML versions of the above

  htmlhelp/htmlhelp.xsl   - for HTML Help
  javahelp/javahelp.xsl   - for JavaHelp
  eclipse/eclipse.xsl     - for Eclipse Help

  manpages/docbook.xsl    - for groff/nroff man pages

To transform documents created with the DocBook Slides schema/DTD,
use one of the following stylesheets:

  slides/html/*.xsl       - for HTML slides of various kinds
  slides/xhtml/*.xsl      - for XHTML slides of various kinds
  slides/fo/plain.xsl     - for XSL-FO slides
  slides/htmlhelp/...     - for HTML Help slides

To transform documents created with the DocBook Website
schema/DTD, use one of the following stylesheets:

  website/website.xsl     - for non-tabular, non-chunked output
  website/tabular.xsl     - for tabular, non-chunked output
  website/chunk-*         - for chunked output
