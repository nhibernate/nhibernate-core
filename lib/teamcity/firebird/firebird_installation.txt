Installation steps for Firebird for NH TeamCity:

1.  Download Firebird (Firebird-3.0.2.32703_0_x64):  https://www.firebirdsql.org/en/server-packages/;
2.  Run the installer ... Use the default firebird password: masterkey. If wanting to support .Net provider lower than v3, enable legacy connection support.
3.  Leave other settings with their defaults.
4.  The setup should install Firebird on the machine;
5.  Go into Firebird folder (c:\program files\firebird\) and create a folder named Data.

Creating the NH database:

a.  Open ISQL (start -> programs -> Firebird -> ISQL);
b.  Type:
create database 'localhost:c:\Program Files\Firebird\Data\NHibernate.fdb' page_size 8192
user 'sysdba' password 'masterkey';

Please do not omit "localhost:", otherwise file access rights will not be adequate. Specifying localhost ensures
the database is created by the server process. Otherwise it is create in embedded mode, with connected user acl.

d.  Add in "Live Databases" section:
nhibernate = C:\Program Files\Firebird\Data\NHIBERNATE.FDB
