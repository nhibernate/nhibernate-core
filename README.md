Welcome to NHibernate
=====================

NHibernate is a mature, open source object-relational mapper for the .NET framework. It is actively developed,
fully featured and used in thousands of successful projects.

The NHibernate community website - <http://nhibernate.info> - has a range of resources to help you get started,
including [howtos][A1], [blogs][A2] and [reference documentation][A3].

Latest Version
--------------

The quickest way to get the latest release of NHibernate is to add it to your project using 
NuGet (<http://nuget.org/List/Packages/NHibernate>).

Alternatively binaries are available from SourceForge at <http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate>.

You are encouraged to review the release notes ([releasenotes.txt](releasenotes.txt)), particularly when upgrading to a 
later version. The release notes will generally document any breaking changes.

Community Forums
----------------

There are two official NHibernate community forums:

* [NHibernate Users][B1] - a forum for users to find help using NHibernate
* [NHibernate Development][B2] - a forum for the developers of NHibernate

[B1]: http://groups.google.com/group/nhusers
[B2]: http://groups.google.com/group/nhibernate-development

Bug Reports
-----------

If you find any bugs, please report them using the [GitHub issue tracker][C1]. A
test-case that demonstrates the issue is usually required. Instructions on providing a test-case
can be found [here][C2].
