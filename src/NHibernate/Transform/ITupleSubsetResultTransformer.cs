	/// <summary>
	/// A ResultTransformer that operates on "well-defined" and consistent
	/// subset of a tuple's elements.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks> "Well-defined" means that:
	/// <ol>
	///    <li>
	///        the indexes of tuple elements accessed by an
	///        ITupleSubsetResultTransformer depends only on the aliases
	///        and the number of elements in the tuple; i.e, it does
	///        not depend on the value of the tuple being transformed;
	///    </li>
	///    <li>
	///        any tuple elements included in the transformed value are
	///        unmodified by the transformation;
	///    </li>
	///    <li>
	///        transforming equivalent tuples with the same aliases multiple
	///        times results in transformed values that are equivalent;
	///    </li>
	///    <li>
	///        the result of transforming the tuple subset (only those
	///        elements accessed by the transformer) using only the
	///        corresponding aliases is equivalent to transforming the
	///        full tuple with the full array of aliases;
	///    </li>
	///    <li>
	///        the result of transforming a tuple with non-accessed tuple
	///        elements and corresponding aliases set to null
	///        is equivalent to transforming the full tuple with the
	///        full array of aliases;
	///    </li>
	/// </ol>
