			// WARNING: This test case makes use of reflection resulting in failures if internals change, but reflection was needed to allow for simulation.
			// This test simulates a heavy load on the QueryPlanCache by making it use a SoftLimitMRUCache instance with a size of 1 instead of the default of 128.
			// Since this cache moves the most recently used query plans to the top, pushing down the less used query plans until they are removed from the cache,
			// the smaller the size of the cache the sooner the query plans will be dropped, making it easier to simulate the problem.
			//
			// What is the exact problem:
			// -> When executing a LINQ query that has a contains with only one element in the collection the same queryExpression string is generated by 2 different types
			//    of IQueryExpression, the 'NHibernate.Impl.ExpandedQueryExpression' and the 'NHibernate.Linq.NhLinqExpression' and that key is used to store a query plan
			//    in the QueryPlanCache if a query plan is requested and not found in the cache.
			// -> The 'NHibernate.Linq.NhLinqExpression' is typically added during the DefaultQueryProvider.PrepareQuery and the 'NHibernate.Impl.ExpandedQueryExpression' 
			//    less likely during the execution of the LINQ query
			// -> Unfortunately the PrepareQuery is casting the returned query plan's QueryExpression to a NhLinqExpression, which it assumes will always be the case, but this
			//    is not true in a heavy loaded environment where the cache entries are constantly moving when other queries are being executed at the same time.
			// -> If you look at the following method inside the DefaultQueryProvider class, then you'll see that by drilling down in the PrepareQuery and in the ExecuteQuery, that
			//    both operations are actually requesting the query plan from the QueryPlanCache at some point
			//    public virtual object Execute(Expression expression)
			//    {
			//      IQuery query;
			//      NhLinqExpression nhQuery;
			//      NhLinqExpression nhLinqExpression = PrepareQuery(expression, out query, out nhQuery);
			//      return ExecuteQuery(nhLinqExpression, query, nhQuery);
			//    }
			//    
			//    When they are requesting the corresponding query plan according to the QueryExpression's key the PrepareQuery assumes it will get back a NhLinqExpression, while it
			//    is perfectly possible that the corresponding query plan has a QueryExpression of type ExpandedQueryExpression that has been added during the ExecuteQuery because
			//    when a request was made for the query plan during the execution, the load on the cache has put the query plan with a QueryExpression of type NhLinqExpression and with 
			//    the same key somewhere at the bottom of the MRU cache and it might even have been removed from the cache, resulting in adding a query plan with a QueryExpression value
			//    of type ExpandedQueryExpression. When the same LINQ query is executed afterwards, it will go through the PrepareQuery again, assuming that what is returned is a 
			//    NhLinqExpression, while in reality it is an ExpandedQueryExpression, resulting in a cast exception. This problem might even go away due to the same load, pushing out 
			//    the cached query plan with a QueryExpression of ExpandedQueryExpression and have a NhLinqExpression added back again during the next Prepare.
			//
			//    So this test will simulate the pushing out by clearing the cache as long as the QueryExpression of the query plan is NhLinqExpression, once it is an ExpandedQueryExpression
			//    it will stop clearing the cache, and the exception will occur, resulting in a failure of the test. 
			//    The test will pass once all LINQ expression are executed (1000 max) and no exception occured
