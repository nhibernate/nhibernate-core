    <title>HQL: The Hibernate Query Language</title>
    
    <para>
        NHibernate is equipped with an extremely powerful query language that (quite intentionally)
        looks very much like SQL. But don't be fooled by the syntax; HQL is fully object-oriented,
        understanding notions like inheritance, polymorphism and association.

        <title>Case Sensitivity</title>

        <para>
            Queries are case-insensitive, except for names of .NET classes and properties.
            So <literal>SeLeCT</literal> is the same as
            <literal>sELEct</literal> is the same as
            <literal>SELECT</literal> but
            <literal>Eg.FOO</literal> is not
            <literal>Eg.Foo</literal> and
            <literal>foo.barSet</literal> is not
            <literal>foo.BARSET</literal>.
        </para>
        
        <para>
            This manual uses lowercase HQL keywords. Some users find queries with uppercase keywords 
            more readable, but we find this convention ugly when embedded in C# code.

        <title>The from clause</title>

        <para>
            The simplest possible NHibernate query is of the form:

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Cat]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            which simply returns all instances of the class <literal>Eg.Cat</literal>. 
        </para>
        
        <para>
            Most of the time, you will need to assign an <emphasis>alias</emphasis>, since
            you will want to refer to the <literal>Cat</literal> in other parts of the
            query.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Cat as cat]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            This query assigns the alias <literal>cat</literal> to <literal>Cat</literal>
            instances, so we could use that alias later in the query. The <literal>as</literal>
            keyword is optional; we could also write:
        </para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Cat cat]]></programlisting>
        
        <para>
            Multiple classes may appear, resulting in a cartesian product or "cross" join.

        <para>
            It is considered good practice to name query aliases using an initial lowercase,
            consistent with naming standards for local variables
            (eg. <literal>domesticCat</literal>).

            In addition, a "fetch" join allows associations or collections of values to be 
            initialized along with their parent objects, using a single select. This is particularly 
            useful in the case of a collection. It effectively overrides the outer join and
            lazy declarations of the mapping file for associations and collections. See
            <xref linkend="performance-fetching"/> for more information.

            The associated objects are not returned directly in the query results. Instead, they may 
            be accessed via the parent object.
        </para>

        <para>
            It is possible to create a cartesian product by join fetching more than one collection in
            a query, so take care in this case. Join fetching multiple collection roles is also
            disabled for bag mappings. Note also that the <literal>fetch</literal> construct may not
            be used in queries called using <literal>Enumerable()</literal>. Finally, note that
            <literal>full join fetch</literal> and <literal>right join fetch</literal> are not meaningful.

        <para>
            will return all instances of <literal>Foo</literal> for which
            there exists an instance of <literal>Bar</literal> with a

            <literal>StartDate</literal> property of the

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Cat cat where cat.Mate.Name is not null]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            This query translates to an SQL query with a table (inner) join. If you were to write
            something like
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Foo foo  
where foo.Bar.Baz.Customer.Address.City is not null]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            you would end up with a query that would require four table joins in SQL.
        </para>

        <para>
            The <literal>=</literal> operator may be used to compare not only properties, but also 
            instances:

        <para>
            The special property (lowercase) <literal>id</literal> may be used to reference the 
            unique identifier of an object. (You may also use its property name.)
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.Cat as cat where cat.id = 123

from Eg.Cat as cat where cat.Mate.id = 69]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The second query is efficient. No table join is required!
        </para>

        <para>
            Properties of composite identifiers may also be used. Suppose <literal>Person</literal> 
            has a composite identifier consisting of <literal>Country</literal> and 
            <literal>MedicareNumber</literal>.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Bank.Person person

    and account.Owner.id.MedicareNumber = 123456]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Once again, the second query requires no table join.
        </para>
            
        <para>
            Likewise, the special property <literal>class</literal> accesses the discriminator value
            of an instance in the case of polymorphic persistence. A .Net class name embedded in the 
            where clause will be translated to its discriminator value.

        <para>
            You may also specify properties of components or composite user types (and of components 
            of components, etc). Never try to use a path-expression that ends in a property of component 
            type (as opposed to a property of a component). For example, if <literal>store.Owner</literal>
            is an entity with a component <literal>Address</literal>
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[store.Owner.Address.City    // okay
store.Owner.Address         // error!]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            An "any" type has the special properties <literal>id</literal> and <literal>class</literal>,
            allowing us to express a join in the following way (where <literal>AuditLog.Item</literal>
            is a property mapped with <literal>&lt;any&gt;</literal>).
        </para>
       
        <programlisting><![CDATA[from Eg.AuditLog log, Eg.Payment payment 
where log.Item.class = 'Eg.Payment, Eg, Version=...' and log.Item.id = payment.id]]></programlisting>
    
        <para>
            Notice that <literal>log.Item.class</literal> and <literal>payment.class</literal>
            would refer to the values of completely different database columns in the above query.

            is one of NHibernate's main selling points. Here are some example queries very similar to queries

            total value. In determining the prices, it uses the current catalog. The resulting SQL query,

            <literal>CATALOG</literal> and <literal>PRICE</literal> tables has four inner joins and an

            As this solution can't return a <literal>User</literal> with zero messages
