    <para>
        Persistent classes are classes in an application that implement the entities
        of the business problem (e.g. Customer and Order in an E-commerce application).
        Persistent classes have, as the name implies, transient and also persistent
        instance stored in the database.
    </para>

    <para>
        NHibernate works best if these classes follow some simple rules, also known
        as the Plain Old CLR Object (POCO) programming model.

        <sect2 id="persistent-classes-poco-accessors">
            <title>Declare properties for persistent fields</title>

            <para>
                <literal>Cat</literal> declares properties for all the persistent fields.
                Many other <emphasis>ORM tools</emphasis> directly persist instance variables. We believe 
                it is far better to decouple this implementation detail from the persistence 
                mechanism. NHibernate persists properties, using their getter and setter methods.
            </para>

            <para>
                Properties need <emphasis>not</emphasis> be declared public - NHibernate can
                persist a property with an <literal>internal</literal>, <literal>protected</literal>,
                <literal>protected internal</literal> or <literal>private</literal> visibility.
            </para>

            <para>
                As shown in the example, both automatic properties and properties with a
                backing field are supported.

        <sect2 id="persistent-classes-poco-constructor">
            <title>Implement a default constructor</title>

            <para>
                <literal>Cat</literal> has an implicit default (no-argument) constructor. All 
                persistent classes must have a default constructor (which may be non-public) so 
                NHibernate can instantiate them using <literal>Activator.CreateInstance()</literal>.
            </para>

        <sect2 id="persistent-classes-poco-identifier">

            <para>
                <literal>Cat</literal> has a property called <literal>Id</literal>. This property 
                holds the primary key column of a database table. The property might have been called 
                anything, and its type might have been any primitive type, <literal>string</literal>
                or <literal>System.DateTime</literal>. (If your legacy database table has composite
                keys, you can even use a user-defined class with properties of these types - see the
                section on composite identifiers below.)
            </para>

            <para>
                The identifier property is optional. You can leave it off and let NHibernate keep track 
                of object identifiers internally. However, for many applications it is still
                a good (and very popular) design decision.

                What's more, some functionality is available only to classes which declare an

                A central feature of NHibernate, <emphasis>proxies</emphasis>, depends upon the
                persistent class being non-sealed and all its public methods, properties and
                events declared as virtual. Another possibility is for the class to implement
                an interface that declares all public members.

                You can persist <literal>sealed</literal> classes that do not implement an interface
                and don't have virtual members with NHibernate, but you won't be able to use proxies

        <para>
            You have to override the <literal>Equals()</literal> and <literal>GetHashCode()</literal>
            methods if you intend to mix objects of persistent classes (e.g. in an <literal>ISet</literal>).
        </para>

        <para>
            <emphasis>This only applies if these objects are loaded in two different
            <literal>ISession</literal>s, as NHibernate only guarantees identity (<literal> a == b </literal>,

            <literal>ISession</literal>!</emphasis>
        </para>

        <para>
            Even if both objects <literal>a</literal> and <literal>b</literal> are the same database row
            (they have the same primary key value as their identifier), we can't guarantee that they are
            the same object instance outside of a particular <literal>ISession</literal> context.
        </para>

        <para>
            The most obvious way is to implement <literal>Equals()</literal>/<literal>GetHashCode()</literal>
            by comparing the identifier value of both objects. If the value is the same, both must
            be the same database row, they are therefore equal (if both are added to an <literal>ISet</literal>,
            we will only have one element in the <literal>ISet</literal>). Unfortunately, we can't use that
            approach. NHibernate will only assign identifier values to objects that are persistent,
            a newly created instance will not have any identifier value! We recommend implementing
            <literal>Equals()</literal> and <literal>GetHashCode()</literal> using
            <emphasis>Business key equality</emphasis>.
        </para>

        <para>
            Business key equality means that the <literal>Equals()</literal>
            method compares only the properties that form the business key, a key that would
            identify our instance in the real world (a <emphasis>natural</emphasis> candidate key):

        <para>
            Keep in mind that our candidate key (in this case a composite of name and birthday)
            has to be only valid for a particular comparison operation (maybe even only in a
            single use case). We don't need the stability criteria we usually apply to a real

            Persistent entities don't necessarily have to be represented as POCO classes
            at runtime. NHibernate also supports dynamic models
            (using <literal>Dictionaries</literal> or C# <literal>dynamic</literal>). With this approach,
            you don't write persistent classes, only mapping files.

        <para>
            The following examples demonstrates the dynamic model feature.
            First, in the mapping file, an <literal>entity-name</literal> has to be declared
            instead of a class name:

            Note that even though associations are declared using target class names,

            The advantages of a dynamic mapping are quick turnaround time for prototyping
            without the need for entity class implementation. However, you lose compile-time
            type checking and will very likely deal with many exceptions at runtime. Thanks
            to the NHibernate mapping, the database schema can easily be normalized and sound,
            allowing to add a proper domain model implementation on top later on.

        <para>
            <literal>NHibernate.Tuple.Tuplizer</literal>, and its sub-interfaces, are responsible
            for managing a particular representation of a piece of data, given that representation's
            <literal>NHibernate.EntityMode</literal>.  If a given piece of data is thought of as
            a data structure, then a tuplizer is the thing which knows how to create such a data structure
            and how to extract values from and inject values into such a data structure.  For example,
            for the POCO entity mode, the corresponding tuplizer knows how create the POCO through its
            constructor and how to access the POCO properties using the defined property accessors.
            There are two high-level types of Tuplizers, represented by the
            <literal>NHibernate.Tuple.Entity.IEntityTuplizer</literal> and <literal>NHibernate.Tuple.Component.IComponentTuplizer</literal>
            interfaces.  <literal>IEntityTuplizer</literal>s are responsible for managing the above mentioned
            contracts in regards to entities, while <literal>IComponentTuplizer</literal>s do the same for
            components.

            Users may also plug in their own tuplizers.  Perhaps you require that a <literal>IDictionary</literal> /
            <literal>DynamicObject</literal> implementation other than NHibernate own implementation is used while
            in the dynamic-map entity-mode; or perhaps you need to define a different proxy generation strategy
            than the one used by default.  Both would be achieved by defining a custom tuplizer
            implementation.  Tuplizers definitions are attached to the entity or component mapping they
            are meant to manage.  Going back to the example of our customer entity:

            <literal>OnSave()</literal>, <literal>OnDelete()</literal> and
            <literal>OnUpdate()</literal> may be used to cascade saves and
            deletions of dependent objects. This is an alternative to declaring cascaded
            operations in the mapping file. <literal>OnLoad()</literal> may
            be used to initialize transient properties of the object from its persistent
            state. It may not be used to load dependent objects since the
            <literal>ISession</literal> interface may not be invoked from
            inside this method. A further intended usage of <literal>OnLoad()</literal>, 
            <literal>OnSave()</literal> and <literal>OnUpdate()</literal> is to store a 
            reference to the current <literal>ISession</literal> for later use.

        <para>
            Note that <literal>OnUpdate()</literal> is not called every time the object's
            persistent state is updated. It is called only when a transient object is passed
            to <literal>ISession.Update()</literal>.

            If <literal>OnSave()</literal>, <literal>OnUpdate()</literal> or
            <literal>OnDelete()</literal> return <literal>LifecycleVeto.Veto</literal>, the operation is 
            silently vetoed. If a <literal>CallbackException</literal> is thrown, the operation 
            is vetoed and the exception is passed back to the application.

        <para>
            Note that <literal>OnSave()</literal> is called after an identifier is assigned to

            If the persistent class needs to check invariants before its state is
            persisted, it may implement the following interface:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[public interface IValidatable
{
        void Validate();
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The object should throw a <literal>ValidationFailure</literal> if an invariant 
            was violated. An instance of <literal>Validatable</literal> should not change 
            its state from inside <literal>Validate()</literal>.
        </para>
        <para>
            Unlike the callback methods of the <literal>ILifecycle</literal> interface, 
            <literal>Validate()</literal> might be called at unpredictable times. The
            application should not rely upon calls to <literal>Validate()</literal> for
            business functionality.
