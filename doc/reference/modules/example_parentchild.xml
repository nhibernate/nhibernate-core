    <title>Example: Parent/Child</title>

    <para>
        One of the first things that new users want to do with NHibernate is to model a parent/child type
        relationship. There are two different approaches to this. The most convenient
        approach, especially for new users, is to model both <literal>Parent</literal> and <literal>Child</literal>
        as entity classes with a <literal>&lt;one-to-many&gt;</literal> association from <literal>Parent</literal>
        to <literal>Child</literal>. The alternative approach is to declare the <literal>Child</literal> as a
        <literal>&lt;composite-element&gt;</literal>. The default semantics of a one to many
        association in NHibernate are much less close to the usual semantics of a parent/child relationship than
        those of a composite element mapping. We will explain how to use a <emphasis>bidirectional one to many
        association with cascades</emphasis> to model a parent/child relationship efficiently and elegantly.

    <sect1 id="example-parentchild-collections">
        <title>A note about collections</title>

        <para>
            NHibernate collections are considered to be a logical part of their owning entity and not of the
            contained entities. Be aware that this is a critical distinction that has the following consequences:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
            <para>
                When you remove/add an object from/to a collection, the version number of the collection owner
                is incremented.
            </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
            <para>
                If an object that was removed from a collection is an instance of a value type (e.g., a composite
                element), that object will cease to be persistent and its state will be completely removed from
                the database. Likewise, adding a value type instance to the collection will cause its state to
                be immediately persistent.
            </para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
            <para>
                Conversely, if an entity is removed from a collection (a one-to-many or many-to-many
                association), it will not be deleted by default. This behavior is completely consistent; a
                change to the internal state of another entity should not cause the associated entity to vanish.
                Likewise, adding an entity to a collection does not cause that entity to become persistent, by
                default.
            </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            Adding an entity to a collection, by default, merely creates a link between the two entities. Removing
            the entity will remove the link. This is appropriate for all sorts of cases. However, it is not
            appropriate in the case of a parent/child relationship. In this case, the life of the child is bound to
            the life cycle of the parent.
        </para>

        <para>
            Suppose we start with a simple <literal>&lt;one-to-many&gt;</literal> association from
            <literal>Parent</literal> to <literal>Child</literal>.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set name="Children">
    <key column="parent_id" />
    <one-to-many class="Child" />
</set>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            If we were to execute the following code:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = ...;
Child c = new Child();
p.Children.Add(c);
session.Save(c);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            NHibernate would issue two SQL statements:
        </para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>an <literal>INSERT</literal> to create the record for <literal>c</literal></para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>
                    an <literal>UPDATE</literal> to create the link from <literal>p</literal> to
                    <literal>c</literal>
                </para>
            </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>
            This is not only inefficient, but also violates any <literal>NOT NULL</literal> constraint on the
            <literal>parent_id</literal> column. You can fix the nullability constraint violation by specifying
            <literal>not-null="true"</literal> in the collection mapping:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set name="Children">
    <key column="parent_id" not-null="true"/>
    <one-to-many class="Child"/>
</set>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            However, this is not the recommended solution.
        </para>

        <para>
            The underlying cause of this behavior is that the link (the foreign key
            <literal>parent_id</literal>) from <literal>p</literal> to <literal>c</literal> is not considered
            part of the state of the <literal>Child</literal> object and is therefore not created in the
            <literal>INSERT</literal>. The solution is to make the link part of the <literal>Child</literal>
            mapping.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<many-to-one name="Parent" column="parent_id" not-null="true"/>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            You also need to add the <literal>Parent</literal> property to the <literal>Child</literal> class.
        </para>

        <para>
            Now that the <literal>Child</literal> entity is managing the state of the link, we tell the collection not
            to update the link. We use the <literal>inverse</literal> attribute to do this:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set name="Children" inverse="true">
    <key column="parent_id"/>
    <one-to-many class="Child"/>
</set>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The following code would be used to add a new <literal>Child</literal>:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
Child c = new Child();
c.Parent = p;
p.Children.Add(c);
session.Save(c);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Only one SQL <literal>INSERT</literal> would now be issued.
        </para>

        <para>
            You could also create an <literal>AddChild()</literal> method of <literal>Parent</literal>.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[public void AddChild(Child c)
{
    c.Parent = this;
    children.Add(c);
}]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            The code to add a <literal>Child</literal> looks like
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
Child c = new Child();
p.AddChild(c);
session.Save(c);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

    <sect1 id="example-parentchild-cascades">
        <title>Cascading lifecycle</title>

        <para>
            You can address the frustrations of the explicit call to <literal>Save()</literal> by using
            cascades.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set name="Children" inverse="true" cascade="all">
    <key column="parent_id"/>
    <one-to-many class="Child"/>
</set>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            This simplifies the code above to:

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
Child c = new Child();
p.AddChild(c);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Similarly, we do no more need to iterate over the children when saving or deleting a
            <literal>Parent</literal>. The following removes <literal>p</literal> and all its children
            from the database.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
session.Delete(p);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            However, the following code:
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
// Get one child out of the set
Child c = p.Children.First();

p.Children.Remove(c);
c.Parent = null;
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            will not remove <literal>c</literal> from the database. In this case, it will only remove
            the link to <literal>p</literal> and cause a <literal>NOT NULL</literal> constraint violation.
            You need to explicitly <literal>Delete()</literal> the <literal>Child</literal>.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[Parent p = session.Load<Parent>(pid);
// Get one child out of the set
Child c = p.Children.First();

p.Children.Remove(c);
session.Delete(c);
session.Flush();]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            In our case, a <literal>Child</literal> cannot exist without its parent. So if we remove a
            <literal>Child</literal> from the collection, we do want it to be deleted. To do this, we must
            use <literal>cascade="all-delete-orphan"</literal>.
        </para>

        <programlisting><![CDATA[<set name="Children" inverse="true" cascade="all-delete-orphan">
    <key column="parent_id"/>
    <one-to-many class="Child"/>
</set>]]></programlisting>

        <para>
            Even though the collection mapping specifies <literal>inverse="true"</literal>, cascades are still
            processed by iterating the collection elements. If you need an object be saved, deleted or
            updated by cascade, you must add it to the collection. It is not enough to simply set its parent.
        </para>

        <title>Using cascading <literal>Update()</literal></title>

        <para>
            Suppose we loaded up a <literal>Parent</literal> in one <literal>ISession</literal>, made some
            changes in a UI action and wanted to persist these changes in a new <literal>ISession</literal>
            by calling <literal>Update()</literal>. The <literal>Parent</literal> will contain a collection
            of children and, since the cascading update is enabled, NHibernate needs to know which children
            are newly instantiated and which represent existing rows in the database. We will also assume
            that both <literal>Parent</literal> and <literal>Child</literal> have generated identifier
            properties of type <literal>long</literal>. NHibernate will use the identifier and
            version/timestamp property value to determine which of the children are new. (See
            <xref linkend="manipulatingdata-updating-detached"/>.)
        </para>

        <para>
            The <literal>unsaved-value</literal> attribute is used to specify the identifier value of a newly
            instantiated instance. <emphasis>In NHibernate it is not necessary to specify
            <literal>unsaved-value</literal> explicitly.</emphasis>

        <para>
            The following code will update <literal>parent</literal> and <literal>child</literal> and insert

        <para>
            This may be suitable for the case of a generated identifier, but what about assigned identifiers
            and composite identifiers? This is more difficult, since NHibernate cannot use the identifier
            property to distinguish between a newly instantiated object, with an identifier assigned by the
            user, and an object loaded in a previous session. In this case, NHibernate will either use the
            timestamp or version property, or will actually query the second-level cache or, worst case, the
            database, to see if the row exists.

            There is quite a bit to digest here and it might look confusing first time around. However, in practice, it
            all works out quite nicely. Most NHibernate applications use the parent / child pattern in many places.
        </para>

        <para>
            We mentioned an alternative in the first paragraph. None of the above issues exist in the case of
            <literal>&lt;composite-element&gt;</literal> mappings, which have exactly the semantics of a parent/child
            relationship. Unfortunately, there are two big limitations to composite element classes: composite elements
            cannot own collections, and they should not be the child of any entity other than the unique parent. (However,
            they <emphasis>may</emphasis> have a surrogate primary key, using an <literal>&lt;idbag&gt;</literal> mapping.)
