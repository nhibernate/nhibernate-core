        NHibernate is not itself a database. It is a lightweight object-relational
        mapping tool. Transaction management is delegated to the underlying database
        connection. If the connection is enlisted with a distributed transaction,
        operations performed by the <literal>ISession</literal> are atomically part
        of the wider distributed transaction. NHibernate can be seen as a thin adapter
        to ADO.NET, adding object-oriented semantics.

            An <literal>ISessionFactory</literal> is an expensive-to-create, threadsafe object 
            intended to be shared by all application threads. An <literal>ISession</literal> 
            is an inexpensive, non-threadsafe object that should be used once, for a single
            business process, and then discarded. For example, when using NHibernate in an
            ASP.NET application, pages could obtain an <literal>ISessionFactory</literal> 
            using

            Each call to a service method could create a new <literal>ISession</literal>,
            <literal>Flush()</literal> it, <literal>Commit()</literal> its connection,
            <literal>Close()</literal> it and finally discard it. (The <literal>ISessionFactory</literal>

            We use the NHibernate <literal>ITransaction</literal> API as discussed previously,
            a single <literal>Commit()</literal> of a NHibernate <literal>ITransaction</literal>
            flushes the state and commits any underlying database connection (with special
            handling of distributed transactions).

            Ensure you understand the semantics of <literal>Flush()</literal>.
            Flushing synchronizes the persistent store with in-memory changes but
            <emphasis>not</emphasis> vice-versa. Note that for all NHibernate ADO.NET
            connections/transactions, the transaction isolation level for that connection
            applies to all operations executed by NHibernate!

            The next few sections will discuss alternative approaches that utilize versioning
            to ensure transaction atomicity. These are considered "advanced" approaches to

                    track of updates made to loaded objects, so a different <literal>ISession</literal>

        <title>Considering object identity</title>

        <para>
            The application may concurrently access the same persistent state in two
            different units-of-work. However, an instance of a persistent class is never shared
            between two <literal>ISession</literal> instances. Hence there are
            two different notions of identity:
        </para>

        <para>
            Then for objects attached to a <emphasis>particular</emphasis> <literal>Session</literal>,
            the two notions are equivalent. However, while the application might concurrently access
            the "same" (persistent identity) business object in two different sessions, the two
            instances will actually be "different" (CLR identity).
        </para>
        <para>
            This approach leaves NHibernate and the database to worry about concurrency. The
            application never needs to synchronize on any business object, as long as it sticks to a
            single thread per <literal>ISession</literal> or object identity (within an
            <literal>ISession</literal> the application may safely use <literal>==</literal> to
            compare objects).

        <title>Optimistic concurrency control</title>

        <para>
            Many business processes require a whole series of interactions with the user
            interleaved with database accesses. In web and enterprise applications it is
            not acceptable for a database transaction to span a user interaction.
        </para>

        <para>
            Maintaining isolation of business processes becomes the partial responsibility
            of the application tier, hence we call this process a long running
            <emphasis>application transaction</emphasis>. A single application transaction
            usually spans several database transactions. It will be atomic if only one of
            these database transactions (the last one) stores the updated data, all others
            simply read data.
        </para>

        <para>
            The only approach that is consistent with high concurrency and high
            scalability is optimistic concurrency control with versioning. NHibernate
            provides for three possible approaches to writing application code that
            uses optimistic concurrency.

            <para>
                A single <literal>ISession</literal> instance and its persistent instances are
                used for the whole application transaction.
            </para>

            <para>
                The <literal>ISession</literal> uses optimistic locking with versioning to
                ensure that many database transactions appear to the application as a single
                logical application transaction. The <literal>ISession</literal> is disconnected
                from any underlying ADO.NET connection when waiting for user interaction. This
                approach is the most efficient in terms of database access. The application
                need not concern itself with version checking or with reattaching detached
                instances.

            <para>
                The <literal>foo</literal> object still knows which <literal>ISession</literal>
                it was loaded it. As soon as the <literal>ISession</literal> has an ADO.NET connection,
                we commit the changes to the object.
            </para>

            <para>
                This pattern is problematic if our <literal>ISession</literal> is too big to
                be stored during user think time, e.g. an <literal>HttpSession</literal> should
                be kept as small as possible. As the <literal>ISession</literal> is also the
                (mandatory) first-level cache and contains all loaded objects, we can propably
                use this strategy only for a few request/response cycles. This is indeed
                recommended, as the <literal>ISession</literal> will soon also have stale data.

                Each interaction with the persistent store occurs in a new <literal>ISession</literal>. 
                However, the same persistent instances are reused for each interaction with the database.
                The application manipulates the state of detached instances originally loaded in another
                <literal>ISession</literal> and then "reassociates" them using

                You may also call <literal>Lock()</literal> instead of <literal>Update()</literal>
                and use <literal>LockMode.Read</literal> (performing a version check, bypassing all

                that reloads all persistent instances from the database before manipulating them.
                This approach forces the application to carry out its own version checking to ensure 
                application transaction isolation. (Of course, NHibernate will still <emphasis>update</emphasis>
                version numbers for you.) This approach is the least efficient in terms of database access.

                Of course, if you are operating in a low-data-concurrency environment and don't

        <para>
            <literal>ISession.Reconnect()</literal> obtains a new connection (or you may supply one) 
            and restarts the session. After reconnection, to force a version check on data you aren't 
            updating, you may call <literal>ISession.Lock()</literal> on any objects that might have
            been updated by another transaction. You don't need to lock any data that you
            <emphasis>are</emphasis> updating.
