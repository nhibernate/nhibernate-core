Build 0.99.1.0 (1.0-rc1)
========================

Breaking changes to external API:
- Updated to a newer version of Castle.DynamicProxy.
  WARNING: this new version has the same number (1.1.5.0) as the version used
           by the previous release of NHibernate, but the binaries are in fact
           different and the old 1.1.5.0 will not work with 1.0-rc1.
- NHibernate no longer configures log4net internally. It is now up to the user
  to configure logging.
- Accessing a disposed or closed ISession or ITransaction now causes
  an ObjectDisposedException. HibernateException or TransactionException could
  be thrown in this case before, such cases were also changed to
  throw ObjectDisposedException.
- Renamed SQLExpression to SQLCriterion per Hibernate 2.1. Now, {alias} should
  be used instead of $alias in SQL criteria.
- Unused constructors for some exceptions were removed.

Breaking changes to NHibernate extension interfaces:
- Renamed IClassPersister.IsDefaultVersion to IsUnsavedVersion. It now takes
  as argument an array of property values instead of an object.
- Renamed IClassPersister.CurrentVersion to GetCurrentVersion to follow naming
  conventions closer.
- Fixed MatchMode.Start and MatchMode.End for Like expressions, their meanings
  were reversed.
- Dialect.AddIdentitySelectToInsert should now return null if the functionality
  is not supported, instead of throwing an exception.

Bug fixes and enhancements:
- Ported almost all remaining Hibernate 2.1 features to NHibernate:
  * subcriteria
  * meta attributes
  * optimistic-lock setting
  * query cache
  * select-before-update
  * batch lazy loading
  * dynamic components
  Missing features are Databinder, ScrollableResults and SchemaUpdate.
- Allow serializing an unflushed session (NH-292, Yves Dierick).
- Check that composite id classes override GetHashCode and Equals.
- Throw QueryException when attempting to fetch multiple collections in
  a query.
- Added a SectionHandler to allow using .cfg.xml syntax to configure NHibernate
  from App.config files. (This was already part of 0.9.1 release but was not
  announced in the release notes.)
- Fixed bug when using joined-subclass with key-many-to-one (NH-369).
- Added IType implementations and constants in NHibernateUtil for unsigned
  integer types.
- Added index attribute for <property>.
- SchemaExport now generates SQL to create an index when index attribute is
  used on <property> or <column>.
- SchemaExport will add an "if exists" clause to "drop table" statement,
  if supported by the dialect.
- Heavy refactoring of the documentation; it now contains the documentation for
  NHibernate Contributions.

- Fixed bug in proxy Equals method always either returning true or failing with a NPE.
