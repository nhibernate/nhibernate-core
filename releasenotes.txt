Tentative for 4.1:

  Possible breaking change: Proxies for classes that used lazy fields (not collections)
  would have any exceptions from the entity wrapped in TargetInvocationException. This
  wrapping exception have now been removed. Where relevant, you should instead catch
  the original exception type you throw.

Build 4.0.0.GA
=============================

** Known BREAKING CHANGES from NH3.3.3.GA to 4.0.0.GA

    NHibernate now targets .Net 4.0. Many uses of set types from Iesi.Collections have
    now been changed to use corresponding types from the BCL. The API for these types
    are slightly different.

    Support for persistent non-generic collections removed. Use the generic counterparts instead.

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * IDeleteEventListener, IEventSource: Use generic ISet<> instead of non-generic in method signatures.
        * SqlString.Parts removed. Use SqlString.Count and SqlString.GetEnumerator().
        * IPersistentCollection.GetSnapshot() now returns object instead of ICollection. The snapshot should be opaque to outside code.
        * Removed IsDiscriminatorFormula, DiscriminatorFormula and GenerateSelectString from UnionSubclassEntityPersister class.
        * Removed ManagedWebSessionContext. Any configuration files which use the "managed_web" session context should now use "web"
        * SybaseASADialect removed: Use SybaseSQLAnywhere10Dialect instead.
        * ASA10ClientDriver, ASAClientDriver and SQLiteDriver removed: Use SybaseSQLAnywhereDriver, SybaseAsaClientDriver, SQLite20Driver instead.
        * Removed Classic HQL Parser.
        * Removed IQueryTranslatorFactory2. It's methods were pulled up to IQueryTranslatorFactory. Method CreateQueryTranslators accepting string as first argument marked as Obsolete. 
        * IQueryExpression.Translate now has second boolean argument 'filter'
        * Added several methods which accepts IQueryExpression to ISessionImplementor, which is duplicating methods which accepts string.
        * Miss-spelled AdoNetWithDistrubtedTransactionFactory removed: Use AdoNetWithDistributedTransactionFactory instead
        * HqlDistinctHolder removed: Use HqlExpressionSubTreeHolder instead
        * DisableLogFormattedSql method removed: the default is disabled
        * ISession.SaveOrUpdateCopy removed: Use Merge instead
        * Oracle and MySQL: The atan2 and power functions now return double (instead of single) for consistency with other dialects.
        * Removed FirebirdDriver. It was the same as FirebirdClientDriver since 3.2, and the latter have been the default since then.
        * Removed bunch of unused methods on *Helper classes
        * Static fields on NHibernateUtil are declared as their exact class

    From NH4.0.0.Alpha1 to 4.0.0.Alpha2:
    Fixed mapping by code behaviour when map child subclasses (see NH-3135 and NH-3269)
    
    The constructor of AbstractComponentTuplizer now behaves like AbstractEntityTuplizer in the way
    that it doesn't create the instantiator any more. Custom component tuplizers that derive
    directly from AbstractComponentTuplizer need to add this line of code in their constructor:
      instantiator = BuildInstantiator(component);

    From NH4.0.0.Alpha2 to 4.0.0.CR1:
    The interface IEnhancedProjection was removed and its methods moved to IProjection.
    Two other overloads of the GetColumnAliases() methods was removed from IProjection.

        * [NH-2290] Invalid hql parenthesis expansion in generated sql
            Unary minus before parentheses in HQL lost the parentheses when translated
            to SQL and therefore the wrong value was returned. This use of unary minus is now
            implemented in the mathematically correct way.


** Bug
    * [NH-3638] - Mapping-by-code is occasionally picking the wrong column name
    * [NH-3654] - Internal access of PersistentGenericBag removed

** Improvement

    * [NH-3586] - Firebird Decimals
    * [NH-3588] - Creating and dropping of Temporary Tables in an isolated transaction is broken
    * [NH-3590] - Detached entity with set of primitives throws

        was flawed - no matter where in the query Take() was placed it was
        always applied as if it had been placed at the end. 3.3.3 fixes this,
        so that Take() now correctly follows the .Net semantics. That is, in
        3.3.3, the following queries might now give different results:

            session.Query<Foo>.OrderBy(...).Take(5).Where(...);
            session.Query<Foo>.Where(...).OrderBy(...).Take(5);

        Starting with 3.3.3, the first query will generate a subquery to correctly
        apply the row limit before the where-clause.

Build 2.1.0
========================
** Known BREAKING CHANGES from NH2.0.xGA to NH2.1.0
    ##### Run time #####
        * If you want work using lazy loading with LinFu.DynamicProxy now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.LinFu.dll
        * If you want work using lazy loading with Castle.DynamicProxy2 now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.Castle.dll
        * If you want work using lazy loading with Spring.Aop now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.Spring.dll
        * compatible only with .NET2.0 SP1 or above (System.DateTimeOffset)
        * In SchemaExport.Execute the parameter "format" was removed; (NH-1701) enabled configuration property format_sql (default true)
        * Antlr3.Runtime.dll is required
        * the syntax foo.bar.baz.elements or foo.bar.baz.indices is not longer supported.  Use the alternative syntax of elements(foo.bar.baz) or indices(foo.bar.baz) instead
            Note: in some case, where a sub-select is needed, the collection is enough example: FROM m IN CLASS Master WHERE NOT EXISTS( FROM m.Details d WHERE NOT d.I=5 )
        * INamingStrategy.PropertyToColumnName does not include the component property path

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * ISession interface has additional methods
        * ICriteria.SetProjection now takes a params array of projections, instead of a single projection
            Only a breaking change if you are implementing ICriteria, there is full source code compatability
        * IStatelessSession interface has additional methods
        * DefaultProxyFactoryFactory removed
        * IProxyFactoryFactory now provide the IProxyValidator implementation
        * Now filters are working even with many-to-one association for Criteria and HQL (NH-1293, NH-1179)

    ##### Initialization time #####
        * The ProxyValidator check for "internal virtual" (to be intercepted by proxy need "protected internal virtual")
        * The session-factory configuration property "proxyfactory.factory_class" is mandatory; You must choose one of the availables NHibernate.ByteCode

    ##### Breaking Changes #####
        * see NH-1633 if you are using SQL native queries
        * CriteriaUtil is gone. NHibernate.Transform.Transformers now returns predefined IResultTransformer.
        * ISessionFactory.Settings is gone (moved to ISessionFactoryImplementor.Settings)
        * Obsolete ORACLE dialects was removed (new implementations are available)
        * ISQLExceptionConverter was changed in order to have more flexibility about information available for the conversion and followed management.
        * ADOException now use string instead SqlString
        * IParameterizedType is using IDictionary<string, string>

Build 2.0.0.GA
========================
** BREAKING CHANGES from NH1.2.1GA to NH2.0.0
    ##### Infrastructure #####
        * .NET 1.1 is no longer supported
        * Nullables.NHibernate is no longer supported (use nullable types of .NET 2.0)
        * Contrib projects moved to http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhcontrib

    ##### Compile time #####
        * NHibernate.Expression namespace was renamed to NHibernate.Criterion
        * IInterceptor have additional methods. (IsUnsaved was renamed IsTransient)
        * INamingStrategy
        * IType
        * IEntityPersister
        * IVersionType
        * IBatcher
        * IUserCollectionType
        * IEnhancedUserType
        * IPropertyAccessor
        * ValueTypeType renamed to PrimitiveType 

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes for external frameworks #####
        * Various classes were moved between namespaces
        * Various classes have been renamed (to match Hibernate 3.2 names)
        * ISession interface have additional methods
        * ICacheProvider
        * ICriterion
        * CriteriaQueryTranslator

    ##### Initialization time #####
        * <nhibernate> section, in App.config, is no longer supported and will be ignored. Configuration schema for configuration file and App.config is now identical, and the App.config section name is: <hibernate-configuration>
        * <hibernate-configuration> have a different schema and all properties names are cheked
        * configuration properties are no longer prefixed by "hibernate.", if before you would specify "hibernate.dialect", now you specify just "dialect"
        * All named queries will be validated at initialization time, an exception will be thrown if any is not valid (can be disabled if needed)
        * Stricter checks for proxying classes (all public methods must be virtual)

    ##### Run time #####
        * SaveOrUpdateCopy() returns a new instance of the entity without changing the original
        * AutoFlush will not occur outside a transaction - Database transactions are never optional, all communication with the database must occur inside a transaction, whatever you read or write data.
        * NHibernate will return long for count(*) queries on SQL Server
        * <formula> must contain parenthesis when needed
        * The HQL functions names may cause conflic in your HQL (reserved names are: substring,locate,trim,length,bit_length,coalesce,nullif,abs,mod,sqrt,upper,lower,cast,extract,concat,current_timestamp,sysdate,second,minute,hour,day,month,year,str)
        * <any> when meta-type="class" the persistent type is a string containing the Class.FullName (In order to set a parameter in a query you must use SetParameter("paraName", typeof(YourClass).FullName, NHibernateUtil.ClassMetaType) )

    ##### Mapping #####
        * <any> : default meta-type is "string" (was "class")

Build 1.2.0.Alpha1
========================

Important Breaking Changes:
    * Entities and collections are lazy by default. Change by setting default-lazy="false"
      in <hibernate-mapping>.
    * Types used as proxies are now validated (a check is done that all public members are
      virtual). Validation can be disabled by setting hibernate.use_proxy_validator to false.
    * ISession.Get/Load now obey where="..." attribute of <class>.
    * Assemblies are signed using a new, publicly available, key.
    * Assembly.LoadWithPartialName is no longer used to load assemblies. If you want NH to load
      an assembly from the GAC, use <qualifyAssembly> element in the configuration file to
      specify its fully qualified name. This change will primarily affect loading of ADO.NET
      data provider assemblies.

Patches Applied:

    * [NH-595] - Possible bug in SessionImpl.EndLoadingCollections method

Build 1.0.1.0
========================

Bugs Fixed:

    * [NH-406] - NHibernate.Cfg.Configuration.Configure("MyAssembly.dll.config") results in System.NullReferenceException
    * [NH-407] - session.Refresh(myObject) does not refresh/load the object from the datbase if it does not exist in the cache.
    * [NH-414] - Need to process <cache> and <collection-cache> in configuration files
    * [NH-417] - Column Alias bug
    * [NH-422] - <meta-value> child tag missing from <many-to-any>

    * [NH-415] - AddXmlString should rethrow exceptions it catches
    * [NH-463] - IncrementGenerator returns Int64 but uses an Int32 internally

New Features:

    * [NH-113] - drop table SQL will now check if the table exists on MS SQL
      to avoid unnecessary warnings.
    * [NH-450] - Added hbm2ddl NAnt task by James Geurts

Improvements:
    * [NH-403] - BinaryType.Get should now perform faster
    * [NH-398] - Bulk property get/set optimization in AbstractEntityPersister
      contributed by Roberto Paterlini. The optimization is enabled by default,
      set hibernate.use_reflection_optimizer property to false in your
      App.config file to disable it. Note that the property is global, thus
      it is only possible to set it in the app.config file in <nhibernate>
      session (see above).
    * [NH-443] - Added more details to "broken column mapping" message
    * [NH-448] - NHibernate configuration process is now closer to Hibernate:
      - hibernate.properties file corresponds to <nhibernate> section
        in app.config (mapped to NameValueSectionHandler)
      - configuration through hibernate.cfg.xml is supported
      - instead of hibernate.cfg.xml, <hibernate-configuration> section
        in app.config (mapped to NHibernate.Cfg.ConfigurationSectionHandler)
        can also be used.
      - creating a new configuration instance in version 1.0 would cause it
        to read <hibernate-configuration> section immediately. In 1.0.1 this
        was changed so that the section is only read when Configure() is called
    * HashCodeProvider is now merged into NHibernate assembly during build,
      thus it does not have to be distributed along with NHibernate.dll.

Build 1.0.0.0
========================

Improvements:
 * ITransaction.Commit and Rollback will not wrap exceptions that derive
   from HibernateException into TransactionExceptions, those exceptions
   will instead be propagated untouched.
 * FieldAccessor now includes correct type in PropertyNotFoundException.
 * Oracle9Dialect will now generate a column of type TIMESTAMP(4)
   for date fields mapped as "datetime".

Build 0.99.3.0 (1.0-rc3)
========================

Bug Fixes:
 * [NH-376] - Expression.In w/ an empty collection causes a SQL exception
 * [NH-382, NH-392] - problems with ADO transactions that plagued previous
   1.0-rcX versions should all be resolved now.
 * [NH-391] - Bug in ReadWriteCache when session is opened with existing
   connection
 * [NH-394] - NullReferenceException in debug print of session objects.
 * [NH-396] - User-provided class names should be trimmed before use
 * [NH-397] - ConfigurationSectionHandler doesn't reads empty properties

Improvements:
 * [NH-388] - Support for the "Any", "Meta-Value" tags
 * Added fetch attribute from Hibernate 3 with values "select"/"join".
   fetch="select" is equivalent to outer-join="false", and fetch="join"
   matches outer-join="true".

Build 0.99.2.0 (1.0-rc2)
========================

Bug Fixes:
 * [NH-377] - Allow whitespace around dialect name in cfg.xml
 * [NH-380] - Error with query after comitted transaction
 * [NH-385] - ADOException thrown instead of StaleObjectStateException when
   updating stale record
 * [NH-386] - Aliases generated for properties with initial underscores should
   NOT begin with an underscore
 * Using Expression.Eq on a many-to-one property now works again (it was broken
   by mistake in 1.0-rc1)

Improvements:
 * [NH-329] - If unsaved-value for <id> or <version> is not specified,
   NHibernate will now try to guess it by instantiating an empty object and
   retrieving default property values from it (as Hibernate 3 does it).
 * The documentation has an "installer" to integrate it in VS .NET Help.

Build 0.99.1.0 (1.0-rc1)
========================

Breaking changes to external API:
- Updated to a newer version of Castle.DynamicProxy.
  WARNING: this new version has the same number (1.1.5.0) as the version used
           by the previous release of NHibernate, but the binaries are in fact
           different and the old 1.1.5.0 will not work with 1.0-rc1.
- NHibernate no longer configures log4net internally. It is now up to the user
  to configure logging.
- Accessing a disposed or closed ISession or ITransaction now causes
  an ObjectDisposedException. HibernateException or TransactionException could
  be thrown in this case before, such cases were also changed to
  throw ObjectDisposedException.
- Renamed SQLExpression to SQLCriterion per Hibernate 2.1. Now, {alias} should
  be used instead of $alias in SQL criteria.
- Unused constructors for some exceptions were removed.

Breaking changes to NHibernate extension interfaces:
- Renamed IClassPersister.IsDefaultVersion to IsUnsavedVersion. It now takes
  as argument an array of property values instead of an object.
- Renamed IClassPersister.CurrentVersion to GetCurrentVersion to follow naming
  conventions closer.
- Fixed MatchMode.Start and MatchMode.End for Like expressions, their meanings
  were reversed.
- Dialect.AddIdentitySelectToInsert should now return null if the functionality
  is not supported, instead of throwing an exception.

Bug fixes and enhancements:
- Ported almost all remaining Hibernate 2.1 features to NHibernate:
  * subcriteria
  * meta attributes
  * optimistic-lock setting
  * query cache
  * select-before-update
  * batch lazy loading
  * dynamic components
  Missing features are Databinder, ScrollableResults and SchemaUpdate.
- Allow serializing an unflushed session (NH-292, Yves Dierick).
- Check that composite id classes override GetHashCode and Equals.
- Throw QueryException when attempting to fetch multiple collections in
  a query.
- Added a SectionHandler to allow using .cfg.xml syntax to configure NHibernate
  from App.config files. (This was already part of 0.9.1 release but was not
  announced in the release notes.)
- Fixed bug when using joined-subclass with key-many-to-one (NH-369).
- Added IType implementations and constants in NHibernateUtil for unsigned
  integer types.
- Added index attribute for <property>.
- SchemaExport now generates SQL to create an index when index attribute is
  used on <property> or <column>.
- SchemaExport will add an "if exists" clause to "drop table" statement,
  if supported by the dialect.
- Heavy refactoring of the documentation; it now contains the documentation for
  NHibernate Contributions.
- Fixed a bug when generating a TOP clause for MS SQL Server - the whole SQL
  string was being converted to lower case.

Build 0.9.1.0
========================
- Fixed bug in limit clause generation on MySQL.
- Fixed bug in Configuration.AddDocument.
- Fixed <version unsaved-value="negative" /> not working with ints or shorts.

- Added IncrementGenerator (Mark Holden).
- Fixed bug with <discriminator> insert attribute not being declared in the schema and having a wrong default value.
- Fixed bug in proxy Equals method always either returning true or failing with a NPE.

- Added more naming strategies (lower case, pascal-case underscored).
- Fixed bug with custom access strategy not working for components.
- Allow using structs (value types) as components.
