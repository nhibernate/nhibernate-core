Build 5.2.0
=============================

Release notes - NHibernate - Version 5.2.0

157 issues were resolved in this release.

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * Mappings mixing column elements and formula elements were taking into account
          only the formula elements. They will now take into account all elements.
        * Mappings mixing column elements and/or formula elements with a column attribute
          or a formula attribute were silently ignoring the attribute. They will now throw.
        * Mappings mixing a column attribute and a formula attribute were silently doing
          some best effort logic, either considering this as a two columns mapping, the
          second one being the formula (most cases), or only taking into account the
          formula (case of the `<element>` mapping). They will now throw.
        * NHibernate StringType has gained case-sensitivity and culture parameters.
          Previously it was ignoring parameters. This type may change its behavior
          for any mapping having defined parameters for this type. See #1833.
        * Mapping a dynamic component with a Hashtable property instead of an
          IDictionary is no more supported.
        * Querying a dynamic entity as a Hashtable instead of an IDictionary is no more
          supported.
        * With PostgreSQL, a HQL query using the bitwise xor operator "^" or "bxor"
          was exponentiating the arguments instead. It will now correctly apply the xor
          operator. (# operator in PostgreSQL SQL.)
        * Auto-generated constraint names will not be the same than the ones generated
          with previous NHibernate versions under .Net Framework. (Under .Net Core those
          names were anyway changing at each run.) The new ones will be the same
          whatever the runtime used for generating them.
        * Some generated PK names may change, if a table name has a quoting symbol at
          precise 13th character.
        * The WcfOperationSessionContext has been removed from .Net Core and .Net
          Standard builds. See #1842.
        * Some classes, which were not serializing the session factory, do now serialize it.
          In case of cross-process serialization/deserialization, these session factories
          will need to be properly named, by setting the session_factory_name setting in the
          configuration used to build them. This may mainly affect users of a distributed
          second level cache, if their cache implementation uses binary serialization.
          Affected classes are: CacheKey, CollectionKey, EntityKey and EntityUniqueKey.
        * Some types cache representations have changed. Out-of-process second level
          caches should be cleared after upgrading NHibernate, if some of those types
          were cached. The concerned types are: CultureInfoType, TypeType, UriType,
          XDocType, XmlDocType.
        * Dialect.GetIdentitySelectString was called by the entity persisters with
          inverted parameter values: the table name in the column parameter, and the
          column name in the table parameter. No built-in dialects were using the
          parameter values. External dialects which were using it inverted (causing issues
          to collection persisters, which have always supplied them correctly) needs
          to be accordingly adjusted.
        * Users providing through an IObjectFactory some custom logic for instantiating
          value types will now need to supply their own result transformer if they were
          using AliasToBeanResultTransformer with value types, or their own entity
          tuplizer if they were using value types as entities.
        * Users providing through an IObjectFactory some custom logic for instantiating
          their custom session contexts will have to implement
          ICurrentSessionContextWithFactory and add a parameterless public constructor
          to their custom context, and move their custom instantiation logic from
          IObjectsFactory.CreateInstance(Type, object[]) to
          IObjectsFactory.CreateInstance(Type).
        * Various *Binding classes of NHibernate will now always have their protected
          dialect field null. (These classes are not expected to be derived by users,
          as there is no way to use custom descendants with NHibernate.)
        * AbstractPersistentCollection.AfterInitialize does no more perform queued
          operations. Queued operations are now run by a later call to a new method,
          ApplyPendingOperations. Concrete custom implementations relying on the queued
          operations to be done by their base AfterInitialize will need to be changed
          accordingly.

Build 5.1.0
=============================

Release notes - NHibernate - Version 5.1.0

** Highlights
    * NHibernate has gained two new target frameworks: .Net Core 2.0 and .Net Standard 2.0. NHibernate NuGet package
      provides them, along with the .Net framework 4.6.1 build.
      For these new frameworks, some additional specificities or limitations apply:
      * Binary serialization is not supported - the user shall implement serialization surrogates for System.Type,
        FieldInfo, PropertyInfo, MethodInfo, ConstructorInfo, Delegate, etc.
      * SqlClient, Odbc, Oledb drivers are converted to ReflectionBasedDriver to avoid the extra dependencies.
      * CallSessionContext uses a static AsyncLocal field to mimic the CallContext behavior.
      * System transactions (transaction scopes) are untested, due to the lack of data providers supporting them.
    * 114 issues were resolved in this release.

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * Since Ingres9Dialect is now supporting sequences, the enhanced-sequence identifier generator will default to
          using a sequence instead of a table. Revert to previous behavior by using its force_table_use parameter.
        * Some overridable methods of the Dialect base class and of MsSql2000Dialect have been obsoleted in favor of
          new methods. Dialects implementors need to override the replacing methods if they were overriding the
          obsolete ones, which are:
          * Dialect.GetIfNotExistsCreateConstraint(Table table, string name), replaced by
            GetIfNotExistsCreateConstraint(string catalog, string schema, string table, string name).
          * Dialect.GetIfNotExistsCreateConstraintEnd(Table table, string name), replaced by
            GetIfNotExistsCreateConstraintEnd(string catalog, string schema, string table, string name).
          * Dialect.GetIfExistsDropConstraint(Table table, string name), replaced by
            GetIfExistsDropConstraint(string catalog, string schema, string table, string name).
          * Dialect.GetIfExistsDropConstraintEnd(Table table, string name), replaced by
            GetIfExistsDropConstraintEnd(string catalog, string schema, string table, string name).
          * MsSql2000Dialect.GetSelectExistingObject(string name, Table table), replaced by
            GetSelectExistingObject(string catalog, string schema, string table, string name).

      http://nhibernate.info/doc/nhibernate-reference/index.html

** Known BREAKING CHANGES from NH4.1.1.GA to 5.0.0

    NHibernate now targets .Net 4.6.1.

    Remotion.Linq and Antlr3 libraries are no more merged in the NHibernate library,
    and must be deployed along NHibernate library. (NuGet will reference them.)

    Classes and members which were flagged as obsolete in the NHibernate 4.x series have been dropped.
    Prior to upgrading, fix any obsolete warning according to its message. See NH-4075 and NH-3684 for a list.

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * All members exposing some System.Data types have been changed for the corresponding System.Data.Common
          types. (IDbCommand => DbCommand, ...)
        * The Date NHibernate type will no more replace by null values below its base value (which was year 1753).
          Its base value is now DateTime.MinValue. Its configuration parameter is obsolete.
        * NHibernate type DateTimeType, which is the default for a .Net DateTime, does no longer cut fractional
          seconds. Use DateTimeNoMsType if you wish to have fractional seconds cut. It applies to its Local/Utc
          counterparts too.
        * LocalDateTimeType and UtcDateTimeType do no more accept being set with a value having a non-matching kind,
          they throw instead.
        * DbTimestamp will now round the retrieved value according to Dialect.TimestampResolutionInTicks.
        * When an object typed property is mapped to a NHibernate timestamp, setting an invalid object in the
          property will now throw at flush instead of replacing it with DateTime.Now.
        * Decimal type registration now correctly handles maximal precision. For most dialects, it is 28, matching
          the .Net limit. Values in mappings above maximal precision will be reduced to maximal precision.
        * Default cast types do no more resolve string to 255 length and decimal to its default precision/scale for
          the dialect. They resolve to 4000 length string and (28, 10) precision/scale decimals by default, and are
          trimmed down according to dialect. Those defaults can be overridden with query.default_cast_length,
          query.default_cast_precision and query.default_cast_scale settings.
        * Future queries with data provider not actually supporting them (not supporting mutliple queries in a single
          SQL command) are no more immediately executed at the .Future call. They are executed only when directly
          enumerated or when their IFutureEnumerable.GetEnumerable method is called. (This aligns them with the behavior
          of FutureValue.)
        * Dialects are now configurable. If you instantiate a dialect directly, make sure you call its Configure
          method, with as argument the properties of a NHibernate Configuration object. You may use instead
          Dialect.GetDialect methods, which configure the dialect before returning it.
        * Transaction scopes handling has undergone a major rework. See NH-4011 for full details.
          ** More transaction promotion to distributed may occur if you use the "flush on commit" feature with
             transaction scopes. Explicitly flush your session instead. Ensure it does not occur by disabling
             transaction.use_connection_on_system_prepare setting.
          ** After transaction events no more allow using the connection when they are raised from a scope
             completion.
          ** Connection enlistment in an ambient transaction is now enforced by NHibernate by default.
          ** The connection releasing is no more directly triggered by a scope completion, but by later
             interactions with the session.
        * AdoNetWithDistributedTransactionFactory has been renamed AdoNetWithSystemTransactionFactory.
        * Subcriteria.UniqueResult<T> for value types now return default(T) when result is null, as was
          already doing CriteriaImpl.UniqueResult<T>.
        * AliasToBeanResultTransformer property/field resolution logic has changed for supporting members
          which names differ only by case. See NH-3693 last comments for details.
        * Linq inequality implementation has been changed for supporting null, meaning that a "a != b" expression
          will now be considered matching if one side is null, while previously due to SQL null semantic it was
          considered non-matching. See NH-3100.
        * Linq extension methods marked with attribute LinqExtensionMethod will no more be evaluated
          in-memory prior to query execution when they do not depend on query results, but will always be
          translated to their corresponding SQL call. This can be changed with a parameter of the attribute.
        * Linq Query methods are now native members of ISession and IStatelessSession instead of being
          extension methods.
        * Linq provider now use Remotion.Linq v2, which may break Linq provider extensions, mainly due to names
          changes. See https://github.com/nhibernate/nhibernate-core/pull/568 changes to test files for examples.
        * NHibernate Linq internals have undergone some minor changes which may break custom Linq providers due
          to method signature changes and additional methods to implement.
        * IMapping interface has an additional Dialect member. ISessionFactoryImplementor has lost it, since it
          gains it back through IMapping.
        * IDriver.ExpandQueryParameters and DriverBase.CloneParameter take an additional argument.
        * NullableType, its descendent (notably all PrimitiveType) and IUserType value getters and setters now
          take the session as an argument. This should mainly impact custom types implementors.
        * EmitUtil is now internal and has been cleaned of unused members.
        * ContraintOrderedTableKeyColumnClosure has been renamed ConstraintOrderedTableKeyColumnClosure.
        * enabledFilter parameter has been removed from IProjection.ToSqlString and ICriterion.ToSqlString methods.
        * Proxy factory and proxy cache now use TypeInfo instead of System.Type. This should be transparent for
          most users.
        * Exceptions which were based on ApplicationException are now based on Exception: HibernateException,
          ParserException and AssertionFailure. The logger factory which could throw a bare ApplicationException
          now throws an InstantiationException instead.
        * ThreadSafeDictionary class has been removed. Use System.Collections.Concurrent.ConcurrentDictionary
          instead.
        * Entity mode switching capability, which had never been fully implemented, is dropped.
        * BytecodeProviderImpl, intended for .Net Framework 1 and broken, is dropped.
        * Sessions concrete classes constructors have been changed. (It is not expected for them to be used
          directly.)
        * Obsolete setting interceptors.beforetransactioncompletion_ignore_exceptions is dropped.
        * SQL Server 2008+ dialects now use datetime2 instead of datetime for all date-time types, including
          timestamp. This can be reverted with sql_types.keep_datetime setting.
        * SQL Server 2008+ timestamp resolution is now 100ns in accordance with datetime2 capabilities, down from
          10ms previously. This can be reverted with sql_types.keep_datetime setting.
        * Oracle 9g+ dialects now use timestamp(7) for all date time types, instead of timestamp(4).
        * Oracle 9g+ timestamp resolution is now 100ns in accordance with timestamp(7) capabilities, down from
          100µs previously. 
        * Oracle: Hbm2dll will no-more choose N- prefixed types for typing Unicode string columns by default.
          This can be changed with oracle.use_n_prefixed_types_for_unicode setting, which will furthermore
          control DbCommand parameters typing accordingly. See NH-4062.
        * SqlServerCe: the id generator "native" will now resolve as table-hilo instead of identity.
        * Firebird: timestamp resolution is now 1ms.
        * PostgreSQL: if Npgsql v3 or later is used, time DbParameters will be fetched as TimeSpan instead of
          DateTime.
        * DB2 & Oracle lite: decimal type registration was hardcoding precision as 19 and was using length as
          scale. It now uses precision and scale from mapping when specified, and disregards length.
        * Ingres & Sybase ASA: decimal type registration was hardcoding precision as 18 and was using length as
          scale. It now uses precision and scale from mapping when specified, and disregards length.
        * ODBC: String parameter length will no more be specified by the OdbcDriver.

    * [NH-4075] - Remove code obsolete in 4.x

** Meta Issue
    * [NH-4011] - Fix transaction scopes handling


Build 4.1.2.GA
=============================

Release notes - NHibernate - Version 4.1.2.GA

** Bug
    * #1355 NH-3928 - Random invalid SQL generated when using bitwise operators

Build 4.1.1.GA
=============================

    ##### Notes #####
    The [NH-3904] has been reverted in favor of [NH-2401]: users now required to explicitly specify
    custom user type via MappedAs method if they want to use IUserType/ICompositeUserType type 
    parameters in Linq queries, or implement generators the way they take the types into account.

** Sub-task
    * [NH-3940] - Revert NH-3904

** Bug
    * [NH-3929] - ExpressionParameterVisitor selects wrong CustomType for ConstantExpression (Linq)
    * [NH-3941] - MappedAs() does not work

Build 4.1.0.GA
=============================

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes Since 4.0 #####
    Proxies for classes that used lazy fields (not collections)
    would have any exceptions from the entity wrapped in TargetInvocationException. This
    wrapping exception have now been removed. Where relevant, you should instead catch
    the original exception type you throw.

    For LINQ queries, the startAt parameter and the return value for string.IndexOf() are
    now correctly translated from .Net's 0-based indexing to SQL's 1-based indexing. LINQ
    queries that are written to expect SQL semantics for IndexOf() will likely need to be
    adjusted (NH-3846, NH-3901).
    Example: A LINQ query should now use 'x=>x.Name.IndexOf("a") == -1' to pick objects where
    the name doesn't contain the letter "a".

Build 4.0.0.GA
=============================

** Known BREAKING CHANGES from NH3.3.3.GA to 4.0.0.GA

    NHibernate now targets .Net 4.0. Many uses of set types from Iesi.Collections have
    now been changed to use corresponding types from the BCL. The API for these types
    are slightly different.

    Support for persistent non-generic collections removed. Use the generic counterparts instead.

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * IDeleteEventListener, IEventSource: Use generic ISet<> instead of non-generic in method signatures.
        * SqlString.Parts removed. Use SqlString.Count and SqlString.GetEnumerator().
        * IPersistentCollection.GetSnapshot() now returns object instead of ICollection. The snapshot should be opaque to outside code.
        * Removed IsDiscriminatorFormula, DiscriminatorFormula and GenerateSelectString from UnionSubclassEntityPersister class.
        * Removed ManagedWebSessionContext. Any configuration files which use the "managed_web" session context should now use "web"
        * SybaseASADialect removed: Use SybaseSQLAnywhere10Dialect instead.
        * ASA10ClientDriver, ASAClientDriver and SQLiteDriver removed: Use SybaseSQLAnywhereDriver, SybaseAsaClientDriver, SQLite20Driver instead.
        * Removed Classic HQL Parser.
        * Removed IQueryTranslatorFactory2. It's methods were pulled up to IQueryTranslatorFactory. Method CreateQueryTranslators accepting string as first argument marked as Obsolete. 
        * IQueryExpression.Translate now has second boolean argument 'filter'
        * Added several methods which accepts IQueryExpression to ISessionImplementor, which is duplicating methods which accepts string.
        * Miss-spelled AdoNetWithDistrubtedTransactionFactory removed: Use AdoNetWithDistributedTransactionFactory instead
        * HqlDistinctHolder removed: Use HqlExpressionSubTreeHolder instead
        * DisableLogFormattedSql method removed: the default is disabled
        * ISession.SaveOrUpdateCopy removed: Use Merge instead
        * Oracle and MySQL: The atan2 and power functions now return double (instead of single) for consistency with other dialects.
        * Removed FirebirdDriver. It was the same as FirebirdClientDriver since 3.2, and the latter have been the default since then.
        * Removed bunch of unused methods on *Helper classes
        * Static fields on NHibernateUtil are declared as their exact class

    From NH4.0.0.Alpha1 to 4.0.0.Alpha2:
    Fixed mapping by code behaviour when map child subclasses (see NH-3135 and NH-3269)
    
    The constructor of AbstractComponentTuplizer now behaves like AbstractEntityTuplizer in the way
    that it doesn't create the instantiator any more. Custom component tuplizers that derive
    directly from AbstractComponentTuplizer need to add this line of code in their constructor:
      instantiator = BuildInstantiator(component);

    From NH4.0.0.Alpha2 to 4.0.0.CR1:
    The interface IEnhancedProjection was removed and its methods moved to IProjection.
    Two other overloads of the GetColumnAliases() methods was removed from IProjection.

        * [NH-2290] Invalid hql parenthesis expansion in generated sql
            Unary minus before parentheses in HQL lost the parentheses when translated
            to SQL and therefore the wrong value was returned. This use of unary minus is now
            implemented in the mathematically correct way.

Build 3.3.5.GA
=============================

** Bug
    * [NH-3795] - C# compiler "Roslyn" regression


Build 3.3.4.GA
=============================

** Bug
    * [NH-3638] - Mapping-by-code is occasionally picking the wrong column name

Build 3.3.3.SP1
=============================

Fixes for regressions introduced in the 3.3.3 cycle.

** Bug
    * [NH-3429] - Exception when debug logging is enabled when using a linq expression that requires a proxy class.
    * [NH-3436] - Linq-Query with IList<X>.Contains fails with NotSupportedException(The constant for 'System.Collections.Generic.List`1[System.Guid]' is not supported) at HqlTreeBuilder.Constant

Build 3.3.3.GA
=============================

BEWARE: In versions prior to 3.3.3.CR1, the handling of the LINQ Take() method
        was flawed - no matter where in the query Take() was placed it was
        always applied as if it had been placed at the end. 3.3.3 fixes this,
        so that Take() now correctly follows the .Net semantics. That is, in
        3.3.3, the following queries might now give different results:

            session.Query<Foo>.OrderBy(...).Take(5).Where(...);
            session.Query<Foo>.Where(...).OrderBy(...).Take(5);

        Starting with 3.3.3, the first query will generate a subquery to correctly
        apply the row limit before the where-clause.

** Bug
    * [NH-2408] - SQL Server pessimistic locking syntax incorrect for union-subclass
    * [NH-3109] - Rounding float values in aggregate functions with group by statements (MySQL).

Build 2.1.0
========================
** Known BREAKING CHANGES from NH2.0.xGA to NH2.1.0
    ##### Run time #####
        * If you want work using lazy loading with LinFu.DynamicProxy now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.LinFu.dll
        * If you want work using lazy loading with Castle.DynamicProxy2 now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.Castle.dll
        * If you want work using lazy loading with Spring.Aop now you must deploy NHibernate.ByteCode.Spring.dll
        * compatible only with .NET2.0 SP1 or above (System.DateTimeOffset)
        * In SchemaExport.Execute the parameter "format" was removed; (NH-1701) enabled configuration property format_sql (default true)
        * Antlr3.Runtime.dll is required
        * the syntax foo.bar.baz.elements or foo.bar.baz.indices is not longer supported.  Use the alternative syntax of elements(foo.bar.baz) or indices(foo.bar.baz) instead
            Note: in some case, where a sub-select is needed, the collection is enough example: FROM m IN CLASS Master WHERE NOT EXISTS( FROM m.Details d WHERE NOT d.I=5 )
        * INamingStrategy.PropertyToColumnName does not include the component property path

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes #####
        * ISession interface has additional methods
        * ICriteria.SetProjection now takes a params array of projections, instead of a single projection
            Only a breaking change if you are implementing ICriteria, there is full source code compatability
        * IStatelessSession interface has additional methods
        * DefaultProxyFactoryFactory removed
        * IProxyFactoryFactory now provide the IProxyValidator implementation
        * Now filters are working even with many-to-one association for Criteria and HQL (NH-1293, NH-1179)

    ##### Initialization time #####
        * The ProxyValidator check for "internal virtual" (to be intercepted by proxy need "protected internal virtual")
        * The session-factory configuration property "proxyfactory.factory_class" is mandatory; You must choose one of the availables NHibernate.ByteCode

    ##### Breaking Changes #####
        * see NH-1633 if you are using SQL native queries
        * CriteriaUtil is gone. NHibernate.Transform.Transformers now returns predefined IResultTransformer.
        * ISessionFactory.Settings is gone (moved to ISessionFactoryImplementor.Settings)
        * Obsolete ORACLE dialects was removed (new implementations are available)
        * ISQLExceptionConverter was changed in order to have more flexibility about information available for the conversion and followed management.

Build 2.0.0.GA
========================
** BREAKING CHANGES from NH1.2.1GA to NH2.0.0
    ##### Infrastructure #####
        * .NET 1.1 is no longer supported
        * Nullables.NHibernate is no longer supported (use nullable types of .NET 2.0)
        * Contrib projects moved to http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhcontrib

    ##### Compile time #####
        * NHibernate.Expression namespace was renamed to NHibernate.Criterion
        * IInterceptor have additional methods. (IsUnsaved was renamed IsTransient)
        * INamingStrategy
        * IType
        * IEntityPersister
        * IVersionType
        * IBatcher
        * IUserCollectionType
        * IEnhancedUserType
        * IPropertyAccessor
        * ValueTypeType renamed to PrimitiveType 

    ##### Possible Breaking Changes for external frameworks #####
        * Various classes were moved between namespaces
        * Various classes have been renamed (to match Hibernate 3.2 names)
        * ISession interface have additional methods
        * ICacheProvider
        * ICriterion
        * CriteriaQueryTranslator

    ##### Initialization time #####
        * <nhibernate> section, in App.config, is no longer supported and will be ignored. Configuration schema for configuration file and App.config is now identical, and the App.config section name is: <hibernate-configuration>
        * <hibernate-configuration> have a different schema and all properties names are cheked
        * configuration properties are no longer prefixed by "hibernate.", if before you would specify "hibernate.dialect", now you specify just "dialect"
        * All named queries will be validated at initialization time, an exception will be thrown if any is not valid (can be disabled if needed)
        * Stricter checks for proxying classes (all public methods must be virtual)

    ##### Run time #####
        * SaveOrUpdateCopy() returns a new instance of the entity without changing the original
        * AutoFlush will not occur outside a transaction - Database transactions are never optional, all communication with the database must occur inside a transaction, whatever you read or write data.
        * NHibernate will return long for count(*) queries on SQL Server
        * <formula> must contain parenthesis when needed
        * The HQL functions names may cause conflic in your HQL (reserved names are: substring,locate,trim,length,bit_length,coalesce,nullif,abs,mod,sqrt,upper,lower,cast,extract,concat,current_timestamp,sysdate,second,minute,hour,day,month,year,str)
        * <any> when meta-type="class" the persistent type is a string containing the Class.FullName (In order to set a parameter in a query you must use SetParameter("paraName", typeof(YourClass).FullName, NHibernateUtil.ClassMetaType) )

    ##### Mapping #####
        * <any> : default meta-type is "string" (was "class")

Build 1.2.0.Alpha1
========================

Important Breaking Changes:
    * Entities and collections are lazy by default. Change by setting default-lazy="false"
      in <hibernate-mapping>.
    * Types used as proxies are now validated (a check is done that all public members are
      virtual). Validation can be disabled by setting hibernate.use_proxy_validator to false.
    * ISession.Get/Load now obey where="..." attribute of <class>.
    * Assemblies are signed using a new, publicly available, key.
    * Assembly.LoadWithPartialName is no longer used to load assemblies. If you want NH to load
      an assembly from the GAC, use <qualifyAssembly> element in the configuration file to
      specify its fully qualified name. This change will primarily affect loading of ADO.NET
      data provider assemblies.

Patches Applied:

    * [NH-595] - Possible bug in SessionImpl.EndLoadingCollections method

Bugs Fixed:

    * [NH-242] - Hbm2Net looks for template file in the current directory but should in the program directory
    * [NH-467] - Many-to-one ignores "WHERE" class mapping element on associated Class
    * [NH-511] - IVersionType.Seed should be set to 1 instead of 0 for integer types
    * [NH-532] - PropertyNotFoundException ctor throws NullReferenceException

    * [NH-338] - Support .NET 2.0 CLR/BCL features, esp Generics and Nullable Types
    * [NH-353] - Assembly.LoadWithPartialName is obsolete in .NET2
    * [NH-416] - Change default laziness of classes and collections to "true" to match Hibernate 3.1
    * [NH-441] - Make proxy validator optional

    * [NH-525] - Upgrade to latest DynamicProxy

Build 1.0.1.0
========================

Bugs Fixed:

    * [NH-406] - NHibernate.Cfg.Configuration.Configure("MyAssembly.dll.config") results in System.NullReferenceException
    * [NH-407] - session.Refresh(myObject) does not refresh/load the object from the datbase if it does not exist in the cache.

    * [NH-113] - drop table SQL will now check if the table exists on MS SQL
      to avoid unnecessary warnings.
    * [NH-450] - Added hbm2ddl NAnt task by James Geurts

Improvements:
    * [NH-403] - BinaryType.Get should now perform faster
    * [NH-398] - Bulk property get/set optimization in AbstractEntityPersister
      contributed by Roberto Paterlini. The optimization is enabled by default,
      set hibernate.use_reflection_optimizer property to false in your
      App.config file to disable it. Note that the property is global, thus
      it is only possible to set it in the app.config file in <nhibernate>
      session (see above).
    * [NH-443] - Added more details to "broken column mapping" message
    * [NH-448] - NHibernate configuration process is now closer to Hibernate:
      - hibernate.properties file corresponds to <nhibernate> section
        in app.config (mapped to NameValueSectionHandler)
      - configuration through hibernate.cfg.xml is supported
      - instead of hibernate.cfg.xml, <hibernate-configuration> section
        in app.config (mapped to NHibernate.Cfg.ConfigurationSectionHandler)
        can also be used.
      - creating a new configuration instance in version 1.0 would cause it
        to read <hibernate-configuration> section immediately. In 1.0.1 this
        was changed so that the section is only read when Configure() is called
    * HashCodeProvider is now merged into NHibernate assembly during build,
      thus it does not have to be distributed along with NHibernate.dll.

Build 1.0.0.0
========================

Improvements:
 * ITransaction.Commit and Rollback will not wrap exceptions that derive
   from HibernateException into TransactionExceptions, those exceptions
   will instead be propagated untouched.
 * FieldAccessor now includes correct type in PropertyNotFoundException.
 * Oracle9Dialect will now generate a column of type TIMESTAMP(4)
   for date fields mapped as "datetime".

Build 0.99.3.0 (1.0-rc3)
========================

Bug Fixes:
 * [NH-376] - Expression.In w/ an empty collection causes a SQL exception
 * [NH-382, NH-392] - problems with ADO transactions that plagued previous
   1.0-rcX versions should all be resolved now.
 * [NH-391] - Bug in ReadWriteCache when session is opened with existing
   connection
 * [NH-394] - NullReferenceException in debug print of session objects.
 * [NH-396] - User-provided class names should be trimmed before use
 * [NH-397] - ConfigurationSectionHandler doesn't reads empty properties

Improvements:
 * [NH-388] - Support for the "Any", "Meta-Value" tags
 * Added fetch attribute from Hibernate 3 with values "select"/"join".
   fetch="select" is equivalent to outer-join="false", and fetch="join"
   matches outer-join="true".

Build 0.99.2.0 (1.0-rc2)
========================

Bug Fixes:
 * [NH-377] - Allow whitespace around dialect name in cfg.xml
 * [NH-380] - Error with query after comitted transaction
 * [NH-385] - ADOException thrown instead of StaleObjectStateException when
   updating stale record
 * [NH-386] - Aliases generated for properties with initial underscores should
   NOT begin with an underscore
 * Using Expression.Eq on a many-to-one property now works again (it was broken
   by mistake in 1.0-rc1)

Improvements:
 * [NH-329] - If unsaved-value for <id> or <version> is not specified,
   NHibernate will now try to guess it by instantiating an empty object and
   retrieving default property values from it (as Hibernate 3 does it).
 * The documentation has an "installer" to integrate it in VS .NET Help.

Build 0.99.1.0 (1.0-rc1)
========================

Breaking changes to external API:
- Updated to a newer version of Castle.DynamicProxy.
  WARNING: this new version has the same number (1.1.5.0) as the version used
           by the previous release of NHibernate, but the binaries are in fact
           different and the old 1.1.5.0 will not work with 1.0-rc1.
- NHibernate no longer configures log4net internally. It is now up to the user
  to configure logging.
- Accessing a disposed or closed ISession or ITransaction now causes
  an ObjectDisposedException. HibernateException or TransactionException could
  be thrown in this case before, such cases were also changed to
  throw ObjectDisposedException.
- Renamed SQLExpression to SQLCriterion per Hibernate 2.1. Now, {alias} should
  be used instead of $alias in SQL criteria.
- Unused constructors for some exceptions were removed.

Breaking changes to NHibernate extension interfaces:
- Renamed IClassPersister.IsDefaultVersion to IsUnsavedVersion. It now takes
  as argument an array of property values instead of an object.
- Renamed IClassPersister.CurrentVersion to GetCurrentVersion to follow naming
  conventions closer.
- Fixed MatchMode.Start and MatchMode.End for Like expressions, their meanings
  were reversed.
- Dialect.AddIdentitySelectToInsert should now return null if the functionality
  is not supported, instead of throwing an exception.

Bug fixes and enhancements:
- Ported almost all remaining Hibernate 2.1 features to NHibernate:
  * subcriteria
  * meta attributes
  * optimistic-lock setting
  * query cache
  * select-before-update
  * batch lazy loading
  * dynamic components
  Missing features are Databinder, ScrollableResults and SchemaUpdate.
- Allow serializing an unflushed session (NH-292, Yves Dierick).
- Check that composite id classes override GetHashCode and Equals.
- Throw QueryException when attempting to fetch multiple collections in
  a query.
- Added a SectionHandler to allow using .cfg.xml syntax to configure NHibernate
  from App.config files. (This was already part of 0.9.1 release but was not
  announced in the release notes.)
- Fixed bug when using joined-subclass with key-many-to-one (NH-369).
- Added IType implementations and constants in NHibernateUtil for unsigned
  integer types.
- Added index attribute for <property>.
- SchemaExport now generates SQL to create an index when index attribute is
  used on <property> or <column>.
- SchemaExport will add an "if exists" clause to "drop table" statement,
  if supported by the dialect.
- Heavy refactoring of the documentation; it now contains the documentation for
  NHibernate Contributions.
- Fixed a bug when generating a TOP clause for MS SQL Server - the whole SQL
  string was being converted to lower case.

Build 0.9.1.0
========================
- Fixed bug in limit clause generation on MySQL.
- Fixed bug in Configuration.AddDocument.
- Fixed <version unsaved-value="negative" /> not working with ints or shorts.
