<h1>What&#39;s New in NDoc2 Alpha 3t?</h1>
<!--	<div class="changed">
        <h3 class="red">Important</h3>
	<p>Do <b>NOT</b> use project files created from previous NDoc2 alpha versions; 
	create new project files from scratch..</p>
    </div>-->
<div>
	<h2><a id="knownissues">Known Issues</h2>
	<h3>VS2005 Solution/Project Import</h3>
	<p>This build does not support import from VS2005 solutions or Projects - you 
	will need to add assemblies and XML docs manually</p>
	<h3>SDK Links</h3>
	<p>MS have created an unfortunate problem with the new v2.0 sdk docs. There 
	are currently now THREE separate distributions of the docs (Framework SDK, VS 
	Express and MSDN library) each with a different help2 namespace name! </p>
	<p>This has left us in a no-win situation, especially for CHM&#39;s. There is no 
	way that NDoc can know which set of docs will be installed on an end-user machine, 
	and no way that the compiled CHM can determine this info a &#39;run-time&#39; (although 
	theoretically possible, security restrictions implemented in XP SP2 prohibit 
	it!).</p>
	<p>NDoc currently assumes the following,<br />
	CHM - The installed SDK docs are those supplied with the MSDN library rather 
	than the .Net 2.0 Framework SDK.<br />
	Help2 - The NDoc-generated docs will be installed (directly, or within another 
	collection) into the VS.NET help collection.<br />
	</p>
	<p>If the sdk links are broken in a chm, there is now a way that the correct 
	Help2 namespace can be specified. Look in the chm&#39;s index and you will find 
	a topic called &#39;SDK Link Manager&#39;. open this topic and correct the namespace 
	in the input field provided, and then navigate to another page. The corrected 
	namespace will be persisted provided that the chm is not moved to another directory 
	in the file-system.</p>
	<div class="changed">
	<h4>SDK links from CHM.</h4>
	<p><span class="Red">In order to guarantee that sdk links are correct, a copy 
	of the .Net framework docs must be present on the build machine.</span> If there 
	are no &#39;reference&#39; docs available, then NDoc will fall back to <i>guessing</i> 
	the url. This generally works without problem, but there are some difficulties 
	with overload members as the MS page naming scheme is somewhat non-deterministic...
	</p>
	<p>Note: It does not matter which source these reference docs came from, either 
	the MSDN or the .Net framework SDK docs will work fine.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Documentation Inheritance</h2>
	<p>This release incorporates several enhancements to help minimize the effort 
	required to document complex APIs.</p>
	<h3>&lt;inheritdoc/&gt;</h3>
	<p>By use of a new tag &lt;inheritdoc/&gt;, documentation can be inherited from base 
	members, interfaces or a DescriptionAttribute.</p>
	<p>The syntax of this new tag is as follows,</p>
	<p><code>&lt;inheritdoc [cref=&quot;link-ref&quot;]/&gt;</code></p>
	<dl>
		<dt>cref (optional)</dt>
		<dd>This attribute overrides the standard search path to allow documentation 
		inheritance from the user-specified location. This attribute is only valid 
		on members within a type.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>If an explicit cref is not specified, the search method is as follows,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If the member is inherited or is an override, the Base Member.</li>
		<li>Any interface member that the member implicitly implements.</li>
		<li><span class="changed">If the member is part of an overload set, the 
		&lt;overloads&gt; tag. <span class="red">(not currently implemented)</span></span></li>
		<li>Any DescriptionAttribute applied to the member.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Searching is recursive.</p>
	<p>Interfaces will be searched in the order they are declared.</p>
	<p>If possible, and appropriate, the &lt;typeparam&gt;, &lt;param&gt;, &lt;value&gt; and &lt;returns&gt; 
	tag contents will be inherited in addition to the &lt;summary&gt;.</p>
	<p>The following table details which tags can be inherited for any given member 
	type,</p>
	<table border="0" width="100%" cellspacing="0" style="border: 1px solid black">
		<tr>
			<th>&nbsp;</th>
			<th>summary</th>
			<th>typeparam</th>
			<th>param</th>

	<div style="margin-left: 12pt; padding: 6pt; background-color: #f8f8f8">
		<b>Why an explicit tag rather than having a single setting to enable inheritance?</b><p>
		An tag has major advantages over a single &#39;global&#39; setting,</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The tag prevents the compiler producing warnings that documentation 
			is missing.</li>
			<li>The tag makes it clear that the user explicitly wishes to inherit 
			documentation, rather than they have accidentally omitted to document 
			a member.</li>
			<li>The tag allows more control when required.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<h3></a><a id="overloads">Overloads</h3>
	<p>Overloads summaries will be <b>automatically</b> inherited if none is supplied 
	by the user.</p>
	<p>The &lt;overloads&gt; tag may specify an &lt;inheritdoc&gt; tag with a cref attribute.</p>
	<p>The search path is as follows,</p>
	<ol>
		<li>An &lt;overloads&gt; tag on the base class.</li>
		<li>An &lt;overloads&gt; tag on any implemented interfaces.</li>
		<li>The first summary found in the overloads list.</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>Explicit Interface Implementations</h3>
	<p>Explicit interface implementations will <b>automatically</b> inherit documentation 
	from the interface member they implement if no documentation is supplied by 
	the user.</p>
	<div style="margin-left: 12pt; padding: 0pt 6pt; background-color: #f8f8f8">
		<p style="padding: 0pt">We do this automatically for 2 reasons, </p>
		<ol>
			<li>These members are, by definition, private and so the compiler will 
			not warn if the user does not supply documentation</li>
			<li>There is no possible ambiguity; the member <b>must</b> be implementing 
			the exact semantics described in the interface documentation.</li>
		</ol>
	</div>
	<h3>AutoDocumentConstructors</h3>
	<p>Constructors cannot be inherited, so documentation inheritance is not possible. 
	However, constructors without any summary comments can be documented with &#39;boiler-plate&#39; 
	text.</p>
	<div style="margin-left: 12pt; padding: 0pt 6pt; background-color: #f8f8f8">
		<h5 style="padding: 0pt;">Static Constructor</h5>
		<p>Initializes the static fields of the <span style="color: blue;"><u>ClassName</u></span> 
		class.</p>
		<h5 style="padding: 0pt;">Instance Constructor</h5>
		<p>Initializes a new instance of the <span style="color: blue;"><u>ClassName</u></span> 
		class.</p>
	</div>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Additional Framework Documentation</h2>
	<p>This release of NDoc is supplied with additional xml docs for all framework 
	assemblies. They augment the standard xml docs supplied with the framework by 
	providing &lt;overloads&gt; summary descriptions for all the overloaded members in 
	the framework assemblies. This improves the quality of the generated documentation, 
	especially in &#39;members&#39; list topics. </p>
	<p>These docs are automatically imported as required, and require no additional 
	setup by the user.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Exclude</h2>
	<p>The &lt;exclude/&gt; tag directs NDoc2 to exclude the item, <b>and any children</b>, 
	from the documentation. It can be applied to any documentable item (namespace, 
	type or member).</p>
	<p>The exclude is now correctly applied if a member is inherited. If an excluded 
	member is overridden in a derived type the exclude tag must be re-applied. However, 
	if the overriding member specifies &lt;inheritdoc/&gt;, then any underlying exclude 
	is also applied.</p>
	<p>Explicit interface implementations automatically inherit any exclude applied 
	to the interface members.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Incremental Builds</h2>
	<p>NDoc can now perform incremental builds.</p>
	<p>Once a full build has been completed with <b>CleanIntermediates</b> set to 
	false (the default), the new settings flag <b>IncrementalBuild</b> can be set 
	to true. </p>
	<p>NDoc will perform a normal reflection/merge step, but will only rebuild those 
	pages that have changed. This should help to speed things up for users with 
	large projects... </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Changes to &#39;Global&#39; settings such as Title will force the incremental 
		build <b>OFF</b>.</li>
		<li>Comparison between builds is performed at the type-level. Any change 
		to a type or its members will result in the rebuilding of all topics within 
		the type.</li>
		<li>Assembly Version (and Assembly File Version) are not considered in comparisons. 
		If the version has changed, only the re-generated topics will reflect the 
		change.</li>
		<li>Topics for types/members which no longer exist in the assembly will 
		be removed from the generated documentation.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>MSDN style documenters</h2>
	<p>The HtmlHelp1(CHM) and Web output has been split into separate documenters. 
	This will ease future enhancements to the Web output to make it more standards 
	compliant (and hence usable with FireFox!)</p>
	<p><b>Note:</b> I have not yet finalized the naming of the documenters - if 
	you have comments/suggestions, please let me know...</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Performance</h2>
	<p>NDoc scaled very badly with page generation throughput dropping significantly 
	on large projects. The internal structure of the documenters has been redesigned, 
	and performance should now be far more linear. In addition, the absolute throughput 
	should be considerably better, partly because of the improvements in .net 2.0 
	xslt processing and also because the NDoc processing path and algorithms have 
	been significantly optimized.</p>
	<p>This release uses much less memory resources than previous releases…</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>QA</h2>
	<h3>QA Log</h3>
	<p>A QA log is produced on each run of NDoc. This logs any QA problems detected 
	within the build. This is experimental; I will be adding additional tests later, 
	and standardizing the message format.</p>
	<h4>What is checked?</h4>
	<h5>Malformed tags</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Completely broken comments (flagged by compiler)</li>
		<li>tags without required attributes</li>
		<li>tags with no contents</li>
		<li>duplicate &lt;param&gt; or &lt;typeparam&gt; tags </li>
	</ul>
	<h5>Missing Documentation</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Ensures all recommended tags exist for type or member. </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>AutoText</h2>
	<h3>Additional Auto-text</h3>
	<p>A group of new settings in the &quot;AutoText&quot; category control the addition of 
	the following &#39;boiler-plate&#39; text fragments to the summary of applicable types/members.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>This class cannot be inherited. </li>
		<li>This class is abstract and so cannot be instantiated. </li>
		<li>This is a static class and so cannot be inherited or instantiated.
		</li>
		<li>This field is read-only and a constant. </li>
		<li>This field is read-only.</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>HighlightInheritedAndAutoText</h3>
	<p>This is a new helper setting. When set to True, any inherited or auto text 
	on a page will show a color-coded highlight (AutoText:green, Inherited:yellow). 
	Additionally, the source of inherited text will be show above the text. </p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>New ShowMissing* Settings</h2>
	<h3>ShowMissingTypeParamsOnTypes</h3>
	<p>When <b>true</b>, NDoc will show where &lt;typeparam&gt; tags are missing on Types.</p>
	<h3>ShowMissingTypeParamsOnMembers</h3>
	<p>When <b>true</b>, NDoc will show where &lt;typeparam&gt; tags are missing on Members.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Visibility</h2>
	<p>The <b>DocumentInternalProtectedAsInternal</b> setting has been removed because 
	it was superfluous and if it was set incorrectly could produce misleading documentation.
	</p>
	<p>NDoc2 will now automatically infer this setting if <b>DocumentProtected</b> 
	is true and <b>DocumentInternal</b> is false.</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>TOC management</h2>
	<h3>Namespace nesting</h3>
	A new setting <b>NamespaceTocStyle</b> has been added to allow namespaces to 
	be nested within the table of contents
	<h3>Inner class nesting</h3>
	A new setting <b>NestedTypeTocStyle</b> has been added to allow inner types 
	to be nested within the table of contents. The types will be placed below the 
	containing type&#39;s members.
	<h3>Short-Filenames</h3>
	Some users have had problems with NDoc abending due to generated filenames exceeding 
	the windows maximum path length. A new setting <b>UseAbbreviatedFileNames</b> 
	has been introduced. When this is set to true NDoc with abbreviate the generated 
	filenames by substituting the namespace section of the filename with a short 
	and (hopefully!) unique hash value.
	<p>Additionally, NDoc will apply an &quot;emergency&quot; truncation of filenames if they 
	would exceed the maximum path length. However this truncation will make the 
	generated filenames very difficult to distinguish or link to from other documentation.
	</p>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Custom Attributes</h2>
	The display of Custom Attributes in syntax sections is now significantly improved.
	<ul>
		<li>Custom Attributes are now show on the style that they coded.</li>
		<li>PInvoke attributes and Pseudo-attributes are now documented.</li>
		<li>Enumerated members values are decoded to their text equivalents.</li>
		<li>There are links from the attributes to their definitions </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Assembly Loading</h2>
	<p>The assembly loading mechanism has been re-written.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Assemblies are always &#39;shadow-copied&#39; - the original assembly is never 
		locked.</li>
		<li>Multi-file assemblies are now correctly loaded regardless of assembly 
		manifest module location.</li>
		<li>Resource-only modules of multi-file assemblies are not loaded unless 
		absolutely required.</li>
		<li>Referenced assemblies are not loaded unless absolutely required.</li>
		<li>Assemblies can be loaded from server shares without raising security 
		exceptions.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Link Errors</h2>
	<p>If a link to external documentation cannot be resolved, the link will be 
	disabled, and displayed in bold.</p>
	<h2>Intellisense documenter</h2>
	The Intellisense documenter is a weird one; it&#39;s not really a documenter in 
	the commonly understood way...
	<p>It&#39;s main use is for ISVs and other developers who produce software that 
	is publicly distributed. In these cases, the xml files generated by the compiler 
	can include a lot of junk. </p>
	<p>For example,<br />
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Only summaries, typeparams, params and exceptions are read by Intellisense, 
		everything else is just a waste of disk-space/processor-cycles.</li>
		<li>Comments on internal and private members shouldn&#39;t be distributed.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p></p>
	<p>This documenter creates a set of Intellisense compatible files from the results 
	of the NDoc reflection/merge process, using the standard NDoc visibility filters 
	to control which members are included. </p>
	<p>This method also has the advantage of producing more complete Intellisense 
	files using the documentation inheritance processes...</p>
</div>
