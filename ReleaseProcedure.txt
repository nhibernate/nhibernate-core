These are the tasks typically needed to create an official NHibernate release.

  * In GitHub, make sure no open issues have milestone set to the release
    that is about to happen (as these will show in the milestone).

  * Create a draft release in Github with GitReleaseManager. If you have used
    the NHibernate build menu, it should be available in Tools\gitreleasemanage.x.x.x\
    (change x.x.x by its current version in tools).
    By example:

Tools\gitreleasemanager.0.7.0\tools\GitReleaseManager.exe create -o nhibernate -r nhibernate-core -m 5.1 -u username -p password

    (Adjust the -m milestone parameter above, and add "-c branchname" if
    releasing another branch than master)

  * Update releasenotes.txt with the list of issues generated in the GitHub
    draft release.
    See if any additions to the list of "known breaking changes" are necessary.

  * Update the GitHub draft release for matching other release formalism: update
    its title, change its description for listing only highlights and breaking
    changes, include links to the milestone and the releasenotes of the release
    tag, include links to binaries on SourceForge and NuGet.

  * Check/update version number in common.xml and NHibernate.props under
    build-common folder, and in master.xml under doc\reference folder.

  * Don't forget to commit the above.

  * Check the CI release build.
    If no error or other issue requiring further changes occurred, merge
    the release PR and wait for the resulting commit CI release build.

  * Retrieve the artifacts of the CI release build.

  * Upload binary and source zip files to SourceForge. Update the "latest
    release".

  * Update download link on nhibernate.info. Update the reference documentation
    if needed.

  * Push nuget packages including the symbol packages.

  * In GitHub, mark the milestone as released and publish the release draft,
    creating the release tag by the way. (It should match the tag in the
    releasenotes link of the release description.)

  * Post release announcement to nhusers, nhibernate-development and as
    project news on SourceForge.

  * If this was a stable branch, merge it forward to master. Perhaps some
    changes need to be edited out in the merge, but this will reduce the
    risk of some issue being left unfixed on master.
